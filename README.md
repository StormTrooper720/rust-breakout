# rust-breakout
A simple breakout copy that uses Rust and Macroquad.

I created this game (with help from tutorials) about how to create a game using rust. I started learning Rust because of its low level abilities but also because it is more simple than C++. This game can be compiled what ever platforms that Macroquad supports. Making this game has helped me understand how Rust works as a language, but this code may not be the best/most optimized.
